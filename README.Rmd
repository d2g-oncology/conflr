# conflr

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/line/conflr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/line/conflr)

conflr is an R package to post [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents to [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), a content collaboration tool by Atlassian.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("line/conflr")
```

## Preparation

Set `CONFLUENCE_URL` to the Confluence endpoint in `.Renviron` (you can open the file with `usethis::edit_r_environ()`).

```
CONFLUENCE_URL=https://confluence.example.com/rest/api
```

## Usage

### 1. Move focus to the .Rmd file and click "Post to Confluence" Addin

(**Caution for those who are not familiar with R Markdown**: R Markdown's powerfulness allows you to execute arbitrary codes; be sure about what the code does before clicking "Post to Confluence"!)
